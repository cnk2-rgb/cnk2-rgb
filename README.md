<h1>Hello, I'm Clarice! Welcome to my Github Page!</h1>
<p>Recently, I have been working on an exciting project dealing with the distribution of homecooked meals which is particularly made to benefit the Asian American elderly community. Read more about the project <a href="https://github.com/catherineclu/my-app" target="blank">here</a>.</p>
<!-- <p>In the next few weeks, I will be studying Machine Learning (namely, TensorFlow) in hopes of launching a new music + ML project. Stay tuned for more!</p> -->

<p>Other information: Unfortunately, my contribution graph has only been correctly updated since July 2023 due to an incorrect configuration.</p>
